            <p> Hello world! My name is Christopher Zhu and I'm a fourth-year <b>Computer Science</b> student at <b>UCLA</b>, originally from <b>Ottawa, Canada</b>. </p> 
            <p> For me, <b>coding</b> is not merely the act of writing code to solve problems, but an extremely creative process where the code that I write is a physical manifestation of my <b>self-expression</b>, representing the way I visualize and analyze a problem to find a solution. I'm fascinated by <b>machine learning</b> and <b>back-end development</b>. </p> 
            <p> You can learn more about me by perusing my resume </p>
